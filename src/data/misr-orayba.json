    "Owing to the success of the ‘MISR WAHASHTONA’ campaign in 2014, entourage was appointed to continue working on Egypt tourism as the preferred advertising agency, but this time with a wider scope and a bigger challenge. The scope was to reach audiences across GCC, Levant and North Africa.",
    "MISR ORAYBA (Egypt is Closer) was the tagline of the campaign. It was inspired by the insight that Egypt is close to every Arab heart because of the bonds of language, customs and traditions and its proximity to other Arab countries.",
    "The campaign was a result of in-depth market research and media analysis, which served as the foundations of the marketing plan. The campaign was showcased across strategic media channels including television, outdoor, magazines, radio and digital advertising as well as social media platforms across 9 key markets: KSA, UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Jordan and Lebanon in addition to North African markets that included Morocco.",
    "Building on the emotional connections, this campaign immediately took to the audiences. The campaign was selected for the best integrated marketing campaign promoting a country category by the MENA Effie Awards."
