    "Promoting a country is a mammoth task and we were chosen to promote Egypt, the country steeped in history and culture. The tourism industry was adversely affected by the political situation of the country from 2011 to 2014 and our challenge was to address the dwindling tourism and turn it around.",
    "We developed a creative strategy to identify the target audience in the region to bring back the Arab tourists to Egypt. We developed a strong campaign message that Arab audiences could relate to and could connect with emotionally - ‘MISR WAHASHTONA’ (Egypt misses you). Simple, effective and ardent, the campaign resonated with the Arab audiences and triggered an emotional response.",
    "In addition to the creative, we fashioned a robust media plan targeting the region. The media plan leveraged media outlets to maximize reach of the campaign and moreover, the message of the campaign. From sponsoring Ramadan shows, to unique outdoor advertising and intelligent use of digital media, as the media agency we made sure that the campaign was a roaring success. It accelerated the growth of tourism in Egypt by 36%, according the tourism ministry."
